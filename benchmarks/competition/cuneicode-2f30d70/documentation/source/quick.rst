cuneicode is a C library whose headers work in both C and C++. Its implementation is currently done in C++. To use it, use:

- one of the many CMake methods (`add_subdirectory`, `FetchContent`, or similar)
- directly add and build all the sources to your project

.. warning::

	Adding sources directly to your project is not guaranteed to work in future major revisions, as certain build steps might generate code in the future.

Once the library is appropriately included, you can start using cuneicode.


Simple Conversions
------------------

To convert from UTF-16 to UTF-8, use the appropriately `c8` and `c16`-marked free functions in the library:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/documentation/quick/source/simple.conversions-utf16.to.utf8.c
	:language: c
	:start-after: // ========================================================================= //
	:linenos:

We use raw ``printf`` to print the UTF-8 text. It may not appear correctly on a terminal whose encoding which is not UTF-8, which may be the case for older Microsoft terminals, some Linux kernel configurations, and deliberately misconfigured Mac OSX terminals. There are also some other properties that can be gained from the use of the function:

- the amount of data read (using ``initial_input_size`` - ``input_size``);
- the amount of data written out (using ``initial_output_size`` - ``output_size``);
- a pointer to any extra input after the operation (``p_input``);
- and, a pointer to any extra output that was not written to after the operation (``p_output``).

One can convert from other forms of UTF-8/16/32 encodings, and from the :term:`wide execution encodings <wide execution encoding>`/:term:`execution encoding <execution encoding>` (encodings used by default for ``const char[]`` and ``const wchar_t[]`` strings) using the various different :ref:`prefixed-based <design-naming-encoding.table>` functions.
