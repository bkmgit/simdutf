/// @param[in, out] __p_maybe_dst_len A pointer to the size of the output buffer (in number of

/// will automatically be considered large enough to handle all data, if
/// `__p_maybe_dst` is not `nullptr`).
/// @param[in, out] __p_maybe_dst A pointer to the pointer of the output buffer. If this or the
/// pointer within are `nullptr`, than this function will not write output data (it may still
/// decrement the value pointed to by
/// `__p_maybe_dst_len`).
/// @param[in, out] __p_src_len A pointer to the size of the input buffer (in number of
/// **elements**). If this is `nullptr` or points to a value equivalent to `0`, then the input is
/// considered empty and CNC_MCERROR_OK is returned.
/// @param[in, out] __p_src A pointer to the pointer of the input buffer. If this or the pointer
/// within are `nullptr`, than the input is considered empty and CNC_MCERROR_OK is returned.

/// value-initialized (`= {0}` or similar) cnc_mcstate_t is used.
///
/// @remarks Note that it is impossible for this type to handle `nullptr` properly for its
/// destination and source arguments because of its templated nature, since that is how it derives
