Multiple (Bulk) Conversion
==========================

Bulk conversions are a way to convert multiple complete units of input into multiple complete units of output (bytes/code units/code points written and/or state changes). Bulk conversions greedily consume input and only stop on exhaustion or error. Unlike :doc:`single conversions</design/single>`, there is no theoretical or logical upper bound for the output buffer that can be given for an encoding transformation without knowing intimate details about the encoding, especially if the input or output encoding is a variable-width (consumes or outputs 1 or more code units depending on what kind of input goes in). Therefore, it is much more probable and likely that an error will return :cpp:enumerator:`CNC_MCERROR_INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT`, which must be handled accordingly in order to fully process the given input.

A bulk conversion can be used to simulate a single conversion by arbitrarily limiting the size of an incoming input to 1 code unit, and seeing if it successfully transcodes. If it reports that the input is incomplete, keep incrementing the size of the incoming input 1 more code unit, until it either eventually reports success (:cpp:enumerator:`CNC_MCERROR_OK`) or failure
